# ProjectMarket

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.1.

## Description: 
We're on a mission to unlock greater opportunities for students to experience meaningful work opportunities during their studies. We’ve thought intensely about how we can achieve this and we’ve come to the conclusion that small to medium businesses are best equipped to allow students to experience meaningful work.
Small to medium business are incredibly practical and hands on in their daily needs and activities. This allows students to get meaningful work opportunities.
By connecting SMBs and universities to collaborate on projects (experiential learning opportunities), we can deliver meaningful value to students and everyone else involved.
The real challenge that we’re overcoming: For many years, SMBs have been resistant to working with graduates due to the costs involved in training them. There is a desperate need for the creation of tools that empower project based learning so that more graduates can get the full experience they expect out of their university degree and ultimately give them the skills they need for work.
This is where we're stepping up. It’s a challenge that requires innovation in the Australian workplace and education system at the same time. But we’re up to the challenge. Because we believe that all students deserve to experience meaningful work as a part of their education and beyond.
The sooner Generation Z students can experience meaningful work, the sooner they can pursue their passion and have a positive impact on the world.
